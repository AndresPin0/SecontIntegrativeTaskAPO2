# SecontIntegrativeTaskAPO2

##The main idea of this integrative Task, is to simulate the game "Snakes and ladders" by console in java SE 1.8.

###What did I use to develop this game. I use circularLinkedList, doubleLinkedList, conditionals, all the program is recursive, it means that it doesn't have any loop in the interface
